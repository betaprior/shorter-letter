# To make texts stronger, follow these specific rules and steps extracted from "Пиши, сокращай":

# Detailed Framework for Making Texts Stronger

1. Eliminate Redundancies
* Remove unnecessary words and phrases: Focus on the essential message.
* Example: Instead of "In order to achieve success, you need to work very hard," write "To succeed, work hard."
2. **Be Clear and Direct**
* Avoid complex sentences: Use simple sentence structures.
* **Example:** Instead of "Due to the fact that it was raining, we decided to stay home," write "Because it was raining, we stayed home."
3. **Focus on the Reader**
* Write from the reader's perspective: Address their needs and problems.
* **Example:** Instead of "Our company offers high-quality products," write "You will get high-quality products from us."
4. **Use Active Voice**
* Prefer active voice over passive voice: It makes sentences clearer and more direct.
* **Example:** Instead of "The project was completed by the team," write "The team completed the project."
5. **Avoid Jargon and Complex Terms**
* Use simple, everyday language: Avoid technical terms unless necessary.
* Example: Instead of "Utilize" write "Use."
6. **Cut Out Filler Words**
* **Remove words that don’t add meaning:** Words like “very,” “really,” “just,” and “quite” can usually be omitted.
* **Example:** Instead of "This is really important," write "This is important."
7. **Be Honest and Sincere**
* **Avoid exaggerations and false claims:** Write truthfully and straightforwardly.
* **Example:** Instead of "Our product is the best on the market," write "Our product is designed to meet your needs."
8. **Use Concrete and Specific Details**
* Provide specific examples and data: Make your writing more credible and engaging.
* Example: Instead of "We have many satisfied customers," write "Over 90% of our customers return for repeat purchases."
9. **Organize Information Logically**
* **Structure your text clearly:** Use headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs.
* **Example:** Break down long paragraphs into smaller sections with clear headings.
10. **Revise and Edit Ruthlessly**
* **Read your text aloud:** It helps identify awkward phrasing and errors.
**Example:** Revise sentences for clarity and conciseness after reading them out loud.
